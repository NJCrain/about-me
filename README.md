# about-me
This is a web page that features five questions about me, the creator. It will ask 5 different questions, all to be answered with a yes/no or y/n. After each question it will tell you if you're wrong or right and will tell you how many you have currently guessed correctly out of the current total possible. The console will also log if each question was correct or incorrect.

This was created as a project for Code Fellows 201 course. It was built inside of VSCode and utilizes the Meyer Reset CSS code to first reset all styling.
